# Issues with this: it's super slow, as it runs a query for each cell.
# It really needs an index to run reasonably fast. Unfortunately the index I want is not supported:
# create index i1 result1(date(created, 'localtime'));
# See https://www.sqlite.org/deterministic.html
# What I can have is:
# create index i1 result1(date(created));
# but this means my days are slightly off: they are aligned to UTC time, not local.
# Also, annoying but acceptable: the table needs to be re-created everytime, to
# take into account any new apps.
